#### Abstract

Understanding the behavioural context of wildlife movement patterns is imperative to the successful conservation of migratory species like cetaceans. The traditional model of baleen whale migration entails uninterrupted journeys performed throughout extended periods of fasting, during which individuals sustain the enormous costs of travelling from poles to tropics only from energy reserves acquired prior to departure. However, this “feast and famine” paradigm is being challenged by increasing observations of supplemental feeding events along whale migratory routes. We provide the first comprehensive account of foraging activity by migrant pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) in the Timor Trough (ca. 126°E, 9.5°S), a deep-water habitat at the southern edge of the animals’ presumed breeding grounds. Using photo-identification and generalised additive modelling (GAM), we analyse visual sightings collected aboard seismic vessels operating southeast of Timor-Leste in the winters of 2007–2008 and demonstrate that: (1) whales engage in surface behaviours characteristic of active feeding, (2) individuals remain within the region for up to several days, and (3) whale presence is significantly associated with predictably high chlorophyll-a concentrations. Despite previous efforts to examine pygmy blue whale movements at low latitudes using long-term satellite telemetry, knowledge of the species’ behavioural ecology in the tropics remains limited. Our results previously unconfirmed evidence that eastern Indian Ocean pygmy blue whales rely on the Timor Trough as a foraging site during the austral winter. Identifying the location of migratory stopovers is key to managing cetacean populations in data-poor ecosystems and predicting their responses to changing ocean conditions.
